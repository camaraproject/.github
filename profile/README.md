## First Meta-Release of CAMARA APIs now available - Fall24 ðŸš€

A CAMARA Meta-release combines a set of CAMARA API versions into a consistent release. All API versions in the meta-release fulfill [defined quality criteria](https://github.com/camaraproject/ReleaseManagement/blob/main/documentation/API-Readiness-Checklist.md) and are compliant to the current CAMARA guidelines in [Commonalities](https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities/releases/latest) and [Identity and Consent Management](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/releases/latest). There will be two meta-releases per year (September and March).

Today we are happy to announce the first **CAMARA meta-release Fall24**. It includes 25 APIs, including the first five stable APIs:
