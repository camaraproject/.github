## First Meta-Release of CAMARA APIs now available - Fall24 ðŸš€

The CAMARA Fall24 Meta-release combines a set of CAMARA API versions into a consistent release. All API versions in the meta-release fulfill defined quality criteria and are compliant to the current CAMARA guidelines in [Commonalities](https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities/releases/latest) and [Identity and Consent Management](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/releases/latest). There will be two meta-releases per year (September and March).
